# Wordle Python

** A Wordle Clone made in Python **

This is a quick project that I made after playing this simples yet very intriging game called Wordle wich you may or may not know, if you want to play
the original one [click here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

In this game you can only play it once a day and then the word refreshes the day after. The game is really addicting and this is a way that you can play the amout of times you want.

Feel free to copy this repo and be sure to have python installed, once installed open your prefered code editor and give it a go.
The code is not perfect, so you can change it at your will and add as a repo on your github.
